 * These objects can modify the state of the LocationMonitor based on its state and are generally used to delegate some management task.
 * For an example look at {@link org.beryl.location.PreferGpsLocationMonitorController} which attempts to use GPS but for responsiveness uses lesser providers until GPS is available.
 * Controllers have the ability to interrupt incoming location readings and toggle providers as they see fit. */
